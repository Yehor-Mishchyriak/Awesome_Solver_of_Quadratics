# AWESOME SOLVER OF QUADRATICS
# VERSION - 1.0
The latest, cutting-edge version of The Awesome Solver of Quadratics - ready for release on smartphones!

Description: The Awesome SQ - is 100% free to use application for mathemathics, more specifically for quadratic equations. It solves complete and incomplete equations with any variables (x, y, t, etc.) and any coefficient positioning. Step-by-step solution helps students better understand the topic. The advantages of this project are that this is very convenient, easy and fast to use.

What's next? I intend to transform this project into something larger and more useful for wider range of people. Soon I'll add graph generation there and solving of quadratic inequations.
